# Fedora RPM Package For tsMuxeR Application

`tsMuxeR` is a simple program to mux video to TS/M2TS files or create BD
disks. See the [home page](https://github.com/justdan96/tsMuxer) for details.

This repository contains a `tsmuxer.spec` file that helps me build
an installation RPM file for `tsMuxeR` for my Fedora 30 desktop. In 
addition, I posted the RPMs that I built in the
[Releases tab](https://github.com/dlk3/tsmuxer-spec/releases) of this
repository
